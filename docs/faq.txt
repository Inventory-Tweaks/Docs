.. _itemtree:

F.A.Q.
======

If you're having troubles making the mod work, or can't manage how to customize things as you want, tell your problem on the `Minecraft Forum topic <www.minecraftforum.net/topic/323444-15-01-inventory-tweaks-v10-beta-2>`_, other users and I will be glad to help!

* **I can't sort items from my mods like I want!**

Currently, you have two solutions, the first being to make rules according to the item ID (e.g. ``D1 489`` or ``D1 489-5`` for a specific damage value).

Second solution, edit the *InvTweaksTree.txt* file from the config folder, to manually add the items you want to sort. Each item is defined by its ID, and the easiest way to find out which item is which ID is to use something like the `Too Many Items <http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/140684->`_ mod. You can gain time by defining item categories by ID ranges, look for that in the advanced documentation.
  
* **The last update broke my InvTweaksTree.txt file!**

Don't worry, you'll find a backup in your config folder. It's just that InvTweaks replaced the tree with a new version, up-to-date with the latest Minecraft items.
  
* **The config files don't appear!**

You're probably running a platform that is not 100% supported by Java. In any case, what you can do is extract manually these files from the Zip: *DefaultConfig.dat* should go to **{MinecraftDir}/config/InvTweaksConfig.txt**, and *DefaultTree.dat* to **{MinecraftDir}/config/InvTweaksTree.txt**.
