Getting started
===============

Setup
-----

Once you have `ModLoader <http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440->`_, this mod is installed by simply moving the ZIP to the **mods** folder of Minecraft.

Basic use
---------

Just start playing Minecraft, you can already use most features of the mod. Notice the "..." button that just appeared on the top-right corner of your inventory? This leads to the mod settings screen, if it's there it means that the mod is installed correctly.

Inventory sorting
~~~~~~~

Trigger the sorting in your inventory by using the **middle click**, or by pressing **R** (by default), at any time. If you want to change the shortcut, check the *Controls* menu in your options. 

Chests sorting
~~~~~~~

When you open a chest, you will see three additional buttons on the higher part of the screen. They allow to sort items in different ways ; but you can also use the middle click if you prefer (click several times to switch the sorting method).

Auto-refill
~~~~~~~

If you eat an item, break a tool or empty a stack by placing blocks, the mod will automatically fetch if possible a similar item from your inventory.

.. note::

   * Click on the "..." button from your inventory to explore the features of the mod. For instance there are a lot of shortcuts that you can use to move items around.
   * You don't even have to be in your inventory to use the **R** shortcut.
