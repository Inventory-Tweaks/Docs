 * Updated to MC 1.7.2 (With many internal changes to support the update)
 * Use ID names, instead on numerical IDs for blocks/items in config files.
 * Messages during the loading process will now display as chat messages the first time you load a game.
 * Rule-based sorting should no longer freeze the game in specific situations.
 * Using IDs in custom rules may or may not work.

 * Fix loading on Forge build 831 and above.

`1.55 (1.6.2) <http://build.technicpack.net/job/Inventory-Tweaks/56/artifact/build/out/InventoryTweaks-MC1.6.2-1.55-b56.jar>`_
 * Sort-on-pickup attempts no longer spam chat messages by repeatedly failing.
 * Auto-refill will now match metadata exactly on items with subtypes (wool, carpet, stained clay, etc.)
 * Major API update, to allow for mods that change the basic player inventory to add compatibility via API.
 * Sorting shortcut automatically disables itself when any standard text field is focused. (Ex: Anvil rename field)
 * Modded containers will never attempt to 'guess' where the main player inventory slots are. Ask the developer of the mod to use the API for compatibility issues.
 * Basic compatibility information can be added to a new configuration file 'InvTweaksCompatibility.xml'. (For modpack builders, this is not a substitute for using the API and will only work correctly for fixed-size chest-like containers)
 * Language files are now loaded using MC1.6's resource pack system, so they can be overriden or new languages added by resource packs.
 * The override button texture file should now be located at 'assets/inventorytweaks/textures/gui/button10px.png'

 * Sorting will order enchanted items before unenchanted items, order among enchanted items is determined by number of enchants, ID of highest-level enchant, and level of highest-level enchant.
